# ARFIMA Library

This library implements fractional differencing and integration using a binomial expansion and supports simulation, fitting, and forecasting for ARFIMA models.

## Overview

ARFIMA models generalize ARIMA processes by allowing the differencing parameter to take non-integer (fractional) values. They are particularly useful for modeling time series with long memory characteristics. This library provides:

- **Fractional Differencing/Integration:** Computes the fractional differencing weights with adaptive truncation.
- **ARMA Innovations Recursion:** Calculates one-step-ahead residuals for the fractionally differenced (stationary) series using AR and MA components.
- **Simulation:** Generates synthetic time series data from ARFIMA models.
- **Parameter Estimation:** Fits model parameters (d, AR, MA) by minimizing the sum of squared innovations.
- **Forecasting:** Makes predictions using the fitted model by forecasting in the stationary domain, then applying fractional integration to revert to the original scale.

## Features

- Fully type-annotated code for improved clarity and maintainability.
- Object-oriented design with an `ARFIMA` class that encapsulates model functionality.
- Implements correct numerical methods for fractional differencing/integration.
- Example usage for simulating data, fitting a model, and generating forecasts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (for plotting in the examples)

You can install NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib via pip if they are not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Installation

Since the ARFIMA library is built from scratch and is provided as a single module, you can simply download the `arfima.py` file and include it in your Python project. Alternatively, if you plan on modifying or extending the library, consider cloning the repository.

## Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the ARFIMA library:

1. **Simulation:** Generate a synthetic ARFIMA(0, d, 0) time series.
2. **Fitting:** Estimate the fractional differencing parameter (d) from the simulated series.
3. **Forecasting:** Forecast future values based on the fitted model.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from arfima import ARFIMA

# 1. Simulate an ARFIMA(0, d, 0) process with d = 0.3
model_sim = ARFIMA(d=0.3)
simulated_series = model_sim.simulate(n=500, random_state=42)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(simulated_series)
plt.title("Simulated ARFIMA(0, 0.3, 0) Series")
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.ylabel("Xâ‚œ")
plt.show()

# 2. Fit an ARFIMA model to the simulated data.
# Start with an initial guess for d (here, 0.2) and no AR or MA components.
model_fit = ARFIMA(d=0.2)
model_fit.fit(simulated_series)
print("Estimated d:", model_fit.d)

# 3. Forecast the next 10 values.
forecasts = model_fit.predict(simulated_series, steps=10)
print("Forecasts:", forecasts)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(np.arange(len(simulated_series)), simulated_series, label="Observed")
plt.plot(np.arange(len(simulated_series), len(simulated_series) + 10),
         forecasts, label="Forecast", marker='o')
plt.xlabel("Time")
plt.legend()
plt.title("ARFIMA Forecast")
plt.show()
```
